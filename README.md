# Large Scale Multi-Agent Simuator

This software package implements an agent-based environment able to simulate multiple interacting populations. Each population is composed by agents represented by non-linear stochastic dynamical systems. Each population can interact with all the other populations in the environment. Additionally, the simulator allows agents to interact with the environment.

# FEATURES

- Multiple populations,
- Heterogenoeus populations,
- Dynamic Environment,
- Possibility to implement *real-time* controllers.
